          Every Human Inventory Solutions will assist the organization in
          understanding, managing, and achieving results with problem inventory.
          With your permission we’ll add your high-risk products; your excess
          and obsolete, your extremely slow-moving inventory items to our
          national database of ‘helping’ products eligible for donation to meet
          existing needs within the greater charitable community. If you’ve
          already developed a list of items, we can immediately match it to our
          database of items serving people in need. If not, we can help you
          create a listing by defining the levels of at-risk products within
          your organization. The objectives are to help you to be able to set
          your cash free and once again enable its productivity unencumbered by
          the burden associated with unproductive excess and obsolete inventory
          assets… while helping people in need. Solutions… to benefit you, your
          organization, and people in need. everyhuman® – we’re better together
