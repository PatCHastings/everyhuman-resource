          As a social enterprise, the term ‘human resource’ means something
          different… it’s about what you, the person or the organization bring
          to the table. It’s that something special revealed during an act of
          compassion. It’s your resourcefulness when you help and serve others.
          It’s the promise you bring when you help people whose only hope is
          hope itself. Hope to improve their circumstance. Hope to get back to
          normal. Hope for a better future. It is people with a vision and the
          inspiration to make things better, and it’s people who can design,
          create, and produce in order to make dreams a reality. It’s people who
          are motivated to turn their lives around. People who can handle
          personal difficulty and turn it into an advantage. We see a world with
          many needs, but it’s also a world filled with hope where hope is the
          motivation, and personal resourcefulness is the means to manifest
          dreams into reality. We feel that our brand name, everyhuman® is
          reflective of a like-minded community working together to be a
          resource for people in need. everyhuman® – we’re better together
